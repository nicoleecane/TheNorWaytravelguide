    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        When traveling Europe, a lot of people skip visiting Norway because of
        how expensive it is. While it’s true that Norway is not a
        budget-friendly destination, it is one of the most beautiful countries
        in the world, rivaling iconic destinations like New Zealand and Iceland
        when it comes to natural beauty.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        To top it all off, Norwegians are wonderful people, almost everyone
        speaks fluent English so it’s easy to navigate, and the scenic fjords
        are never far from sight. And, since Norwegians love nature, there are a
        lot of free outdoor activities that can fill your days without emptying
        your wallet. Wild camping is also free here as well, making it the
        perfect destination for outdoorsy travelers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>1. Check out the fjords</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Surrounded by high cliffs, the fjords of Norway are world renowned and
        breathtakingly beautiful. Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord near Bergen are
        two of the most popular. Other fjords worth seeing include Aurlandsfjord
        (near Flåm), Lysefjord (near Stavanger), and Trollfjord (near Tromsø).
        There are tons of ways to experience Norway’s natural beauty whatever
        your style is, from doing a fjord cruise, a kayaking tour, or going on a
        scenic hike to fully take in the unique landscapes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Explore Oslo</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Oslo is a beautiful small city of just under 700,000 people. Here you
        can browse the National Gallery, explore the Akerhus fortress, check out
        the Viking Ship Museum, see the Royal Palace, or spend an afternoon
        strolling the Aker Brygge wharf. Don’t miss Vigeland Sculpture Park
        either, with its 200 unique statues. The city is also surrounded by
        wilderness, offering plenty of places to hike, bike, swim, and camp
        (and, of course, cross-country ski in the winter).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Visit Bergen</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Bergen is home to tons of hiking trails as well as some of the most
        scenic fjords in the country. Check out the fish market, stroll through
        the historic Gamle Bergen, climb the medieval Rosenkrantz Tower, or hike
        up Mount Fløyen to get a picturesque view of the city below. Just two
        hours outside Bergen, you can enjoy the guided walks (suitable for all
        levels) on the Folgefonna Glaciers and marvel at the colors of the
        spectacular “blue-ice” hike. Folgefonna National Park, home to the
        massive golden eagle, is accessible by public transportation too.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. See Lofoten</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Lofoten is a picturesque scenic area in the far north well worth the
        effort (and cost) to get to. There are beautiful fjords to cruise,
        mountains, wildlife, and a slower pace of life that makes this place
        seem magical. Plus, there’s no shortage of activities to take advantage
        of, from excellent fishing and plenty of opportunities for kayaking,
        photo tours, sailing trips, horseback riding, and more. This is also one
        of several spots to see the Northern Lights mirrored in the water of
        this unique archipelago. It’s one of the most sought-after photography
        destinations in the world.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>5. Tour Trondheim</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Known for its bright and colorful buildings, Trondheim is a laid-back
        city filled with students. Located in the middle of the country, it’s a
        fun destination to party and enjoy late nights out. Be sure to take a
        stroll through the Bakklandet neighborhood, see the Old Town Bridge, and
        visit the spectacular medieval Nidaros cathedral that has attracted
        pilgrims from Oslo for the last 400 years. The Rockheim culture center
        is a tribute to the history of Nordic rock music from 1950 to the
        present with interesting interactive exhibits and displays. If you visit
        in winter, don’t miss the Ice Domes (an ice hotel that you can visit on
        a tour or stay at overnight — for a hefty price!).

    <h3>1. Explore Tromsø</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Perfect for a 24-hour party, Tromsø in the summer is a city that doesn’t
        sleep because the sun is up 24/7! Located in the Arctic Circle over
        1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) north of Olso, tourists come here to
        experience unbroken sunlight amidst the city’s many pubs. Or, if you
        happen to visit in the dark and cold of winter, you can catch the
        vibrant northern lights. It’s also a world-famous fishing destination
        and home to incredible, postcard-perfect fjords. Like Lofoten, this is
        one of the best destinations in the country for photography.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. See the Vigeland Sculptures</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Perfect for a 24-hour party, Tromsø in the summer is a city that doesn’t
        sleeIf you are in Oslo, don’t miss these sculptures. Located in Frogner
        Park, this unique collection is the world’s largest display of
        sculptures created by a single artist. Gustav Vigeland created all 212
        statues in this 80-acre open-air “gallery.” It’s one of the most popular
        places in the summer to have a picnic, relax, people-watch, and enjoy
        the fleeting summer sun. It’s free too.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Take a free walking tour</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        One of the best things you can do when you arrive in a new city is to
        take a walking tour. It’s a great way to get the lay of the land and
        learn about the culture, people, and history of the destination. You can
        find free walking tours in Oslo and Bergen — tours that give you much
        more insight than any guidebook. Just be sure to tip your guides at the
        end!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Check out the Royal Palace</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Built during the first half of the 19th century, the Royal Palace in
        Oslo was the creation of King Charles III who ruled both Norway and
        Sweden at that time. Today, it’s the official residence of the monarch
        (Norway is one of a dozen countries in Europe that still has a monarch).
        Be sure to see the changing of the guards at 1:30pm each day (it lasts
        around 40 minutes) and spend some time relaxing in the 54-acre park that
        surrounds the palace. The palace is open during the summer for guided
        tours (self-guided tours are not permitted) which cost 175 NOK.
        (Currently closed for guided tours until June 2023).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>5. Visit the Norwegian Folk Museum</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        There are many museums throughout Oslo showcasing Norwegian history and
        Viking tales, but this is the most interesting. Home to over 150
        buildings, this open-air museum lets you immerse yourself in the history
        of the country. The biggest attraction is the Gol Stave Church, which
        dates to 1200 CE. Other incredible sights to see are the 14th-century
        farmhouses and the 18th-century tenement buildings. This is a fun
        activity that blends entertainment and education, so it’s a great choice
        for anyone traveling with children. Admission is 180 NOK in summer and
        140 NOK in winter.
