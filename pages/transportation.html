    <h2>How to Get Around Norway</h2>

    <!--start jumbotron-->
    <div class="jumbotrontrans"></div>
    <!--end jumbotron-->

    <h3>Public transportation</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Public transportation in Norway is modern, clean, and reliable. Buses
        and trams are common in each city; only Oslo has a metro system. Single
        tickets cost around 39 NOK and are usually valid for one hour. You can
        get a 24-hour pass in Oslo for 117 NOK and a 7-day pass for 323 NOK. You
        are able to get on most buses and trams without showing a ticket,
        however, patrols are common and the fines are heavy if you get caught
        without a ticket. Don’t risk it — always buy a ticket!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Bus</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Buses are a cheap way to get around the country, though they are slow
        and rather limited since the distances between cities can be large. For
        example, the 8-hour journey from Oslo to Stavanger costs around 115-450
        NOK each way while the bus from Oslo to Trondheim takes around 9 hours
        and costs around 780 NOK. Prices can double when not booked in advance.
        Vy Buss is the most common bus company, though you can also find deals
        with Nor-Way Bussekspress and Flixbus.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Train</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Trains are the best way to get around Norway (unless you’re on a road trip). They are often faster than 
      buses without costing much more — 
      and they are much more comfortable. The 7-hour trip from Oslo to Trondheim costs as little as 360 NOK 
      while the 6.5-hour trip to Bergen from Oslo can cost as little as 290 NOK. 
      The trip from Oslo to Gothenburg, Sweden takes under 4 hours and can be done for less than 250 NOK.
      Reservations should be made in advance as you can often find great deals that way. Last-minute tickets c
      an be double what I quoted above!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Flying</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Flying around Norway isn’t super cheap, but it’s also not that expensive. From Oslo, you can reach most 
        destinations in the country (as well as destinations in Sweden) for as little as 500 NOK (one way)
         if you book early and are flexible. Norwegian Air is the main domestic carrier, though SAS also flies 
         several major routes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Car Rental</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Renting a car is the best way to explore the country, however, it’s not cheap if you’re a solo traveler.
       Expect to pay 470-900 NOK per day for a vehicle if you rent for at least a week. Most rental vehicles are 
       manuals as well, so keep that in mind when renting (you usually have to pay more for an automatic). 
       If you don’t have someone to travel with to keep costs low, check at the local hostels or on Couchsurfing 
       to find people to travel with so you can split costs.
       For the best car rental prices, use Discover Cars.

    <h3>6. Book in advance</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        If you can plan your transportation in advance, you can save up to 50%
        off the cost of your train or bus tickets. Buying last-minute tickets
        means it’s going to be more than any budget traveler can afford,
        especially if you want to visit a number of destinations in Norway. Book
        in advance and save money! With its expansive fjords, famous
        archipelagos, and undeniable beauty, Norway sits at the top of many
        traveler’s bucket lists. Like many people who dream of visiting this
        country, we put it off for years because of the expense compared to
        other travel destinations. During our recent visit, we realized
        traveling here can be done affordably with a little planning.
      </p>

    <h3>Hitchhiking </h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Hitchhiking here is possible in Norway though it’s not very common. Make sure you’re near a main road 
        and be
         prepared for the weather to change rapidly. Also, 
        try to look presentable and have a sign. Wait times can be long so make sure you have flexible plans. 
        HitchWiki is the best website for additional hitchhiking info.
