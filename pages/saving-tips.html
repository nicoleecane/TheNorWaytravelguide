    <h2>Norway Travel Guide: Money-Saving Tips</h2>

        Norway is expensive. There’s no two ways about it. It’s one of the most
        expensive countries in the world and you will be hard pressed to save
        money if you aren’t cooking all your meals or camping. Ultra-budget is
        not impossible, just difficult. Here are some tips to help you save
        money in Norway:
      </p>
    </div>
    <

    <h3>1. Cook your own food</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Food is very expensive in Norway so the best thing you can do is cook
        your own meals. Go grocery shopping and stick to cheap local staples.
        Avoid eating out! If you want to survive on a budget in Norway, having
        some sort of method to make your own meals is essential. Most Norwegians
        only eat out once in a blue moon, but rather prepare their own meals at
        home. If you don’t have thousands of kroner to spend on restaurants, you
        should do the same. So consider paying a little extra for booking a
        cabin, room or apartment with a small kitchen. You might not need
        something fancy, but it will save you a lot of money if you can make
        some of the meals yourself. Most cabins will come with some small
        kitchen appliances, which should be enough to let you make your own
        food. You certainly don’t want to go out for breakfast or lunch unless
        you have a hotel breakfast, so a kitchen that allows you to make your
        own breakfast should be the absolute minimum. A microwave and utensils
        can do wonders, but a stove with a frying pan is even better.
        Fortunately, kitchens are pretty common in apartments and cabins in
        Norway. Hotel room don’t have them, but most other types of
        accommodation do.

    <h3>2. Eat Cheap</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        If you do decide to eat out, your cheapest options are shawarma and
        pizza. They can be found all around the country. Norway can be pretty
        expensive, and a lot of tourists find that most things are more
        expensive than they are used to here in Norway. This includes groceries
        and other items at grocery stores and supermarkets, but there are some
        grocery store chains that are considered to be much cheaper than other.
        So where should you be shopping groceries in Norway to save money? The
        stores Rema 1000, Coop Extra, and Kiwi are considered to be “low price
        supermarkets” that are at least 10 – 15 % cheaper than regular grocery
        stores, and are therefore the cheapest grocery stores in Norway. There
        is not much of a price different between these three, but Rema 1000 or
        Kiwi is usually winners whenever the national news papers do tests to
        see which is actually the cheapest. So always shop at one of these three
        stores if you want to get groceries as cheap as possible. The downside
        to shopping at these places is that they will have a slight smaller
        range of items for sale compared to some of the other supermarket
        chains, but they do have enough for regular Norwegian families to get
        everything they need from them. Most cities and even smaller town will
        have at least one of these close to the c ity center, and it is also
        pretty common to find that even smaller towns have at least two or even
        all three of these.

    <h3>3. Couchsurf</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Use Couchsurfing to connect with locals and get free accommodation. It’s
        the best way to save money and make new friends who can share their
        insider tips and advice. Along with the obvious benefit of finding a
        free place to stay, couchsurfing can enhance your trip in other ways:
        You get a peek behind the tourist scene and can go a little deeper to
        connect with a destination. A good host will provide a better
        understanding of the place you are visiting. Your local friend will know
        the hidden hotspots and can offer money-saving advice for insider sights
        and activities. You'll learn about scams to avoid and where to find the
        best food in town away from the tourist traps. You may have access to a
        kitchen. Grocery shopping and cooking meals at home are cheaper and
        healthier than eating out in restaurants every meal as travelers often
        do. Even if you already have accommodation, you can use the Couchsurfing
        website to find traveler meetups and hangouts. Lasting friendships are
        often formed through couchsurfing. Couchsurfing isn't just for solo
        backpackers! Couples and families with children regularly find hosts who
        share the same interests.

    <h3>4. Camp</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        Free public camping laws allow you to wild camp in the parks and public
        lands for free. You can generally stay 1-2 nights in an area as long as
        you are quiet and respectful. Make sure to leave the area as you found
        it! Norway is a country that is unprecedented in its beauty and no
        matter how hard you try, it is impossible not to find this country
        totally awe-inspiring. While the fjords cut inland, mountains rise out
        of the murky depths creating dramatic scenery before giving away to the
        tundra in the north. While many countries limit you to staying in
        official accommodation or campsites, Norway gives travelers and all of
        its citizens the right to explore the land and wild camp pretty much
        anywhere. Camping atones for the fact that Norway is beyond expensive
        and the ability to pitch up a tent for free means you can save hundreds
        of dollars in accommodation costs in a country where a basic hotel can
        run around $150 a night! The stress of removing the financial burden
        allows you to enjoy nature even more while spending your money on gas or
        eating out the occasional meal.
      </p>

    <h3>5. Get a tourism card</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        The best way to afford all the attractions in a city is to get a city
        tourism card. Oslo and Bergen both have tourism cards that can save you
        money if you plan on seeing a lot (they include free public
        transportation too). Aimed at tourists, the Oslo Pass is a special card
        that lets you enter many museums and attractions in Oslo for free. It
        also lets you use the public transport network for free, and gives money
        off at local attractions and restaurants. The pass is good for 24 hours,
        48 hours or 72 hours, depending on which version you buy. Once you first
        start using the pass, you’ll need to activate it, either online, or by
        writing the date and time on it, depending on which type of pass you
        have. You’ll need to show the pass every time you enter a museum or use
        public transport, so make sure you get the date and time right!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>6. Book in advance</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        If you can plan your transportation in advance, you can save up to 50%
        off the cost of your train or bus tickets. Buying last-minute tickets
        means it’s going to be more than any budget traveler can afford,
        especially if you want to visit a number of destinations in Norway. Book
        in advance and save money! With its expansive fjords, famous
        archipelagos, and undeniable beauty, Norway sits at the top of many
        traveler’s bucket lists. Like many people who dream of visiting this
        country, we put it off for years because of the expense compared to
        other travel destinations. During our recent visit, we realized
        traveling here can be done affordably with a little planning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>7. Stay sober</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        At 100 NOK per drink (or more!), going out for drinks destroys your
        budget. While Norwegians love to go out and have a good time, if you are
        on a tight budget, skip the booze! Alcohol in Norway is subject to
        excessive excise duty. As a consequence, one litre of spirit, 40%, is
        taxed 308 NOK/36 USD per litre in 2019. A litre of beer is taxed at
        12,93NOK/1,50USD. Numbers are valid for 2019. On top of the excise duty,
        Value Added Tax will be applied. The rationale for this is, except for
        generating tax income for the government, is to reduce alcohol
        consumption. Excise duty on alcohol was re-introduced in 1929 when
        prohibition ended.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>8. Buy your drinks at the store</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        If you do plan on drinking, buy your drinks at the Vinmonopolet (the
        state-run chain of stores that sell alcohol). 7 You’ll save 50% or more
        doing this! It is represented by Ⓥ and is idiomatically shortened to
        polet. It is a government-owned alcoholic beverage retailer and the only
        one permitted to sell beverages containing more than 4.75% alcohol. The
        Norwegian government’s policy goal is to limit alcohol consumption,
        primarily through high prices and limited access. Vinmonopolet’s goal is
        to distribute alcoholic beverages responsibly while limiting the
        industry’s private economic profit motive. Vinmonopolet’s social
        responsibility is also significant.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>9. Travel with friends</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        If you rent a car (which is the best way to get around) try to find
        people to join you to share costs. You can use the Couchsurfing platform
        or just ask around in hostels to find people. This will help you save
        money on gas and rental prices — which can eat into your budget quickly!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>10. Take advantage of free activities</h3>

    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <p>
        While Norway is expensive, there are plenty of free activities to be
        enjoyed. Check out the festivals and free concerts held in Bergen’s
        church areas that a ttract many international musicians. Take advantage
        of free admission to the n ational parks and spend your days hiking
        outdoors in the fresh Nordic. Oslo might be an expensive capital but you
        can still wander around Ekebergparken park, the Intercultural museum, or
        visit some art galleries and ruins without breaking the bank.
